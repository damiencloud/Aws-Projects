# 🧠 AWS AI Image Recognition System

This project demonstrates how to use **Amazon Rekognition** to automatically detect objects and labels in images uploaded to **Amazon S3**, with results processed by **AWS Lambda** and indexed for searching via **Amazon OpenSearch Service** (formerly Elasticsearch).

## ⚙️ Architecture

### 🔄 Workflow
1. A user uploads an image to the **Amazon S3 bucket**  
2. The **S3 event notification** triggers an **AWS Lambda function**  
3. Lambda calls **Amazon Rekognition** to detect labels, objects, or scenes in the image  
4. The detected labels and metadata are uploaded to **Amazon OpenSearch Service** for indexing  
5. The indexed data can be **queried or searched** by users in real time

## 🧰 AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Amazon S3** | Stores the uploaded images |
| **AWS Lambda** | Executes the AI workflow on every upload |
| **Amazon Rekognition** | Detects labels and objects in the image |
| **Amazon OpenSearch Service** | Stores and indexes image metadata for fast search |
| **Amazon CloudWatch** | Logs and monitors Lambda executions |
| **AWS IAM** | Provides permission policies for secure service communication |
