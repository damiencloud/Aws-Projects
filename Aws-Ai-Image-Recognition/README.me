# 🧠 AWS AI Image Recognition System

This project demonstrates how to use **Amazon Rekognition** to automatically detect objects and labels in images uploaded to **Amazon S3**, with results processed by **AWS Lambda** and indexed for searching via **Amazon OpenSearch Service** (formerly Elasticsearch).

## ⚙️ Architecture

**Workflow:**
1. User uploads an image to the **S3 bucket**  
2. The S3 event triggers an **AWS Lambda function**  
3. Lambda calls **Amazon Rekognition** to detect labels  
4. Detected labels and metadata are uploaded to **Amazon OpenSearch** for indexing  
5. The indexed data can be queried or searched by users in real time
